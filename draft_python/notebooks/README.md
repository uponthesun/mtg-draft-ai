Jupyter can be a nice tool for writing code for experimenting with stuff:
* It's like an enhanced REPL - run/rerun cells in any order
* Supports rich output like rendering HTML and [plotting](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Part%203%20-%20Plotting%20with%20Matplotlib.ipynb)

Though ultimately YMMV

## Setup

1. If using env manager, activate the environment you've installed this project into.
2. `pip install jupyter`

## Using Jupyter

1. `jupyter notebook` - starts the Jupyter server locally and opens it in your browser
2. Existing notebooks are in this directory, you can navigate there through the UI and run them.
